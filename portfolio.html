     <p>This is a game I made on app inventor called Diglett Smash! You have 60 seconds to get as many points as you can by tapping on the diglett. But be careful, if you accidentally hit the bomb, you'll lose 5 seconds on your timer. Try to get as many points as you can before the timer runs out. Good luck!</p>
